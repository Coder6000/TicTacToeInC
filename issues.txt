- addSymbol checks for occupied Spots and throws a warning, but never lets the user re-enter input (SOLVED)

POSSIBLE SOLUTION: in game() function add a do while loop while isValid = 1. If isValid, it will put the symbol in its spot and continue, if not, it will keep asking the user. 

- When spot is occupied, it prints the warning multiple times

POSSIBLE SOLUTION: else if instead of simply if after the first if statement

- When typing 0 after space occupied warning, it wont exit the game

POSSIBLE SOLUTION: None at the moment
